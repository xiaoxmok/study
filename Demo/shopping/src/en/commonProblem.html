            </div>
            <div class="text" >
               <p>Main concerns of different objects in this project are different. We have concluded it since we have been working closely with educational institutions for many years, providing BYOD solutions.</p>
                <p><strong>Student’s - the user: </strong>Experience oriented. Specs, look, portability, easy-to-use</p>
                <p><strong>Parent - the investor:</strong> Consider thoroughly. Using experience, TCO, quality and stability.</p>
                <p><strong>Teachers/Institution - the manager:</strong> Teaching/Management based. Compatibility, quality, stability, easy to manage. </p>
                <p><strong>Datas are regularly collected:</strong></p>
                <p>Product repair rate, replacement parts cost, repair response time, short/long term using experience etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Based on the data and information above, we will select a few models among the present product line. After the discussion with institution staff, the recommendations will therefore be finalized. </strong></p>
                <p>For more information on different models and compare:
